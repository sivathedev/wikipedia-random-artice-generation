# wikipedia-random-artice-generation
WORKFLOW:
This program first asks the user , if the user is interested to read articles from wikipedia.
If yes, the program searches wikipedia and generates a random article
 >If the user likes the topic, Wikipedia gives the summary of the topic.
   >If the user still continues to like the the topic, the program opens wikipedia in browser for the user to enjoy reading the full article.
   >If the user does not likes the topic or the summary, the program suggests another random article from the internet, until the user likes some article.
 > If the user does not like any topic, another topic is shown randomly
If no, program aborts and loves to help the user any time the user wants to read the article.
